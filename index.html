                    <p>On 16 December 1971 when our position at Jarpal in the Shakargarh Sector was subjected to an attack by a Pakistani armoured regiment and our troops were heavily outnumbered by enemy forces, the squadron commander asked for reinforcements.

On the way, his troop came under fire from enemy strong points and recoillless gun nests that were still holding out in the bridgehead established across the Basantar river by our troops. </p>
